## Georgia Tech

I enrolled at Georgia Tech in 2021 and will be graduating in December 2024 with a B.S. in Computer Science. Georgia Tech Computer Science Majors select 2 concentrations (called 'threads'), of which I selected People (human computer interaction) and Media (computer graphics and creative computing). I love applying these concepts to my roles in product and software, and supplemented my development in other areas of computer science through work-experience, research,hackathons and personal projects.
