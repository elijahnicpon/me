# My personal website!

Thanks for checking out the code to my personal website! 

It's built with Vue 3 and Vite, and hosted on GitHub Pages when I don't break it. 

The website is fully static, and the file structure is generated based on the /files directory in the repo during deployment. 

The design is inspired by an IDE, combining aspects of other personal websites I've admired over the years. I've put a lot of thought into the design and UX of the site, so if you'd like to fork it, all I ask is for you to give me a shoutout and proper attribution! 

If you'd like to get in touch, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elijahnicpon/) or [email me](mailto:eliajh@nicpon.com).
